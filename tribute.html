                <p>
                    Eyanwoods is part of an ideological group called "winning tripods",
                    a group of activists who perform fecal performances in the street.

                     In 2018, Eyanwoods give  himself so much during one of his farting performances,
                      that he fell into a coma, and now ,all the members respect him and call him "fart-man". </p>

            <div class="center ">

                <p>
                    Eyanwoods was the president of the student club "LA LUX" from 2015 to 2018. 
                    He is recognized among the members as one of the best presidents.</p>

                <p>
                    one day Eyanwoods said to me: <span>
                       <i>"fuck her for me or I will hang myself". </i>
                     I'm still thinking about the metaphorical meaning of this philosophical sentence.</p>

            <div class="center ">

                <p>
                   <p> Eyanwoods is often compared to the famous Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic.</p>
                     Remember this famous sentence of Diogenes to Alexander the Great: "Get out of my sun, you're overshadowing me". </p>
